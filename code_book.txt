################# CODE BOOK ##################

The data.frame "alldata" contains all observations.
Values in the data.frame "summarized" are MEANS of the values
  contained in "alldata", grouped by subject and activity.

Units:
linear acceleration: standard gravitational units 'g'
linear jerk: 'g'/second
angular velocity: radians/second
angular jerk: radians/second**2
